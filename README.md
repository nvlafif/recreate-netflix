# recreate-netflix
This is a Netflix website recreate project.
This website is created solely as a practice project for front-end development. I recreated the Netflix website to improve my logical thinking and enhance my skills in front-end development. I cloned the Netflix website as accurately as possible to measure my programming abilities. This website consists only of the front-end (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and does not include any back-end functionality.
